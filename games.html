              Are you ready to have a quacking time? Toucan play this egg-citing game right now! 
              Made by an im-peck-able team of quail-ified developers, you're gonna have no egrets.
              <b>Birds With Guns</b> is a game I made with a friend over the course of a vacation. It's 
              also the first time I ever sold a game, and it's honestly been blowing away all my
              expectations!

            <p>
              <b>Derailed!</b> is yet another Pico-8 game I made to challenge myself. It's a co-op game where
              you'll need high communication to bring the train to its station. It's a fan demake of 
              <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/">Unrailed!</a>, and after 
              I made some concept art for a PICO-8 demake of it, I thought it
              would be fun to actually turn it into a real thing. I hope you'll have fun with it, and maybe you can 
              grab a friend to try it out. (The game is currently unfinished, but it's playable nonetherless)

              <b>Anchors & Miners</b> is my third Pico-8 game, and our entry for Ludum Dare 48, following the theme "Deeper and deeper". 
              We went for a simple arcade style digging game inspired by Downwell and Ridiculous Fishing. As it usually is, it was a lot of fun!

            <h4>Reimagining Google Chrome's secret game</h4>
            <div>—</div>
            <p>
              <b>Pico Dino</b> is what came out as I tried to make something simple, but as polished as possible.
              I really like complexity that rises from simple things, like icons and puzzles (and even math), so I found it very 
              fun trying to come up with a complex moveset from a very simple 2-button control scheme. I originally wanted to 
              add different worlds, power-ups, more enemies, but at some point I had to make something I could actually finish. 
              Nonetherless, I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.<br>
              I sent my game by email to Edward Jung, one of the two creators of the original game, and he seemed to love it, which
              made me very happy.

          <div>—</div>
          <p>
            <b>Chaser Of Dawn</b> is a game that was made for the Ludum Dare 47 game jam. <br>
            We had 3 days to make a game based on the theme "Stuck in a loop", and we used the Pico-8 engine. The game was inspired by 
            exoplanets that don't rotate and have a very big difference in temperature between their two sides. <br>
            It was a lot of fun and we hope to do more games like this in the future!
