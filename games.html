            <h1>Pico Dino</h1>
            <h4>Reimagining Google Chrome's secret game</h4>
            <div>—</div>
            <p>
              <b>Pico Dino</b> is what came out as I tried to make something simple, but as polished as possible.
              I really like complexity that rises from simple things, like icons and puzzles (and even math), so I found it very 
              fun trying to come up with a complex moveset from a very simple 2-button control scheme. I originally wanted to 
              add different worlds, power-ups, more enemies, but at some point I had to make something I could actually finish. 
              Nonetherless, I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.<br>
              I sent my game by email to Edward Jung, one of the two creators of the original game, and he seemed to love it, which
              made me very happy.

          <h1>Chaser Of Dawn</h1>
          <h4>A game about looping around a planet</h4>
          <div>—</div>
          <p>
            <b>Chaser Of Dawn</b> is a game that was made for the Ludum Dare 47 game jam. <br>
            We had 3 days to make a game based on the theme "Stuck in a loop", and we used the Pico-8 engine. The game was inspired by 
            exoplanets that don't rotate and have a very big difference in temperature between their two sides. <br>
            It was a lot of fun and we hope to do more games like this in the future!
